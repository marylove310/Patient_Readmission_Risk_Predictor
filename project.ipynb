    "## *Project Title: Patient Readmission Risk Predictor*\n",
    "#### Project Description\n",
    "The Patient Readmission Risk Predictor is a simple yet effective tool designed to assess a patient's likelihood of hospital readmission based on key health factors such as age, diagnosis, and previous hospital visits. This project leverages Python and Streamlit to provide an interactive, user-friendly web application where healthcare professionals or researchers can input patient details and receive an immediate risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system evaluates risk based on predefined criteria:\n",
    "Patients aged 48 or older are considered at higher risk.\n",
    "Patients with more than 2 previous hospital admissions are flagged as high-risk.\n",
    "The tool provides a clear and structured output showing patient details and their calculated risk level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as an excellent entry point into data-driven healthcare analytics, helping to introduce real-world applications of data science and web development to students and professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "Hospital readmissions are a significant challenge in healthcare, often leading to increased costs, resource strain, and potential health complications for patients. Identifying high-risk patients early can help healthcare providers take proactive measures to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Challenges Addressed by This Project\n",
    "✅ Early Identification of High-Risk Patients – Helps predict which patients are more likely to be readmitted, allowing for better monitoring and intervention.\n",
    "✅ Simplified Risk Assessment – Provides an easy-to-use tool for medical staff or researchers to assess readmission risk without complex medical software.\n",
    "✅ Introduction to Data Science & AI in Healthcare – This project is an educational tool for students learning data science, helping them see the impact of data-driven decision-making in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating Streamlit for an interactive frontend, this project allows non-programmers (such as healthcare practitioners) to use the tool effortlessly while giving students practical experience in building real-world data science applications.\n",
